## client side of the demo

### JS

http://mithril.js.org/

I chose to create frontend with Mithril. I like it very much because it does very well
* two-way data binding
* routing
* controler-view rendering

it is simple and extremly efective amd allowes you to create mini FW implementation
on top of qulity made basic easily.

### Pre-processors

No usage of any pre-processors as SASS or CoffeeScript or TypeScript. 


## OR backend DB mapper

DataMaper becuase it is easier to get it working in Sinatra


## install

bundle install

puma -p 3000 (or whatewer that reads config.ru)
